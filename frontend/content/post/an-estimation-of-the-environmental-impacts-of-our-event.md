Below is an attempt at breaking down the carbon impact of our event. It is an incredibly rough estimation based on a lot of crude guesses but we wanted to at least highlight this as a consideration and as something we hope will be considered more in the future.

Our final number was 249.732 kg, the majority of that coming from the various forms of travel.

If you'd like to know more about the impact of electronic music on clubbing, we really recommend reading the report by Clean Scene ([link](https://cleanscene.club/)) that explores the impact of touring DJs on the environment and discusses ways we can improve the industry.
