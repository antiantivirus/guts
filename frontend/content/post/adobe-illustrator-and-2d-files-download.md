Posters and social media posts for GUTS were rendered using Blender (see the 3D files article/download page [here](https://guts.exposed/post/3d-files-download/)) to 2D images. These images were edited and had text added to them using the program [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/illustrator.html).



Illustrator is great for designing posters like these because it is vector based. Normal image editing programs (like paint or photoshop) are pixel based and as you make the image larger, the pixels become more obvious. However, vector-based images can be enlarged to any size without losing any resolution.



We've made all the text in the documents into outlines so that you can poke around without having all the fonts installed that we used. We've included all the free fonts used in the folder for your use but could not provide the Serial Blur font as this was used under a paid for license.

You will need to download the folder titled links in order for the 2D rendered images to appear correctly in illustrator.
