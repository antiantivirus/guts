The 3D files used in this project were designed by the wonderful [Sam Wood](https://www.instagram.com/sam.woodd/) using the free software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and are free for you to download and use. Please credit him though if you are going to be sharing anything you create! 

Once Sam sent us these files Tom ([body parts](https://www.instagram.com/bodyparts.gla/)) posed the character, created the logo, arranged the elements and rendered out the final results. There are two main downloads - the original files that Sam sent us and the edited file Tom made.

Don't forget to download the HDRI ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ahmG4QD9mV8J-yuzQgwGhrdQJWEa-v65/view?usp=sharing)) that goes with the file to make it look extra crispy and so that the blender file doesn't get confused.

The embedded version of the model was created using [Spline](https://spline.design/) - it was originally supposed to go on the home page but we are still perfecting the materials to look right!
